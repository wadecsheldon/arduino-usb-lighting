# arduino-usb-lighting
Arduino library for making devices controllable via USB HID Lighting and Illumination usages

Note: This library is nowhere near complete and is currently a low priority project for me.
      At the moment it mostly consists of usability wrappers to correct inconsistencies in the Arduino USB libraries.
